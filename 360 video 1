But if we carry on the way we have in recent years, there is an alternative future - one where sea levels rise, causing untold costs, where fish stocks run out, where coral reefs die and the ocean's capacity to keep absorbing our carbon dioxide diminishes",

The first written records that mention this whipping date back to the 14th century, but the tradition is probably much older, perhaps going back to pre-Christian times. Boys and men used to whip girls with willow branches to help them stay Healthy and young. Over time, the branches started to be braided together and, in the end, a long and elaborately braided whip became the pride of its owner. Today, some whips can be several metres long. Naturally, such whips are only used for decoration. In the Czech Republic, boys and men still go whipping, but this tradition is slowly disappearing from the cities. Traditionally, boys and men walk around their neighbourhood with the whip and ask for a reward. They receive a painted egg, a coloured ribbon for their whip, something sweet or something strong. Men especially enjoy the tradition of whipping in Moravia where home-made brandy is popular",
